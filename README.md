# superColliderPatches

SuperCollider is a platform for audio synthesis and algorithmic composition.

SuperCollider is widely used by composers, sound artists, and researchers for its flexibility and powerful synthesis capabilities. It supports a wide range of sound synthesis techniques, from traditional subtractive and additive synthesis to more complex algorithms like granular synthesis and physical modeling.

This repo has patches I created.
